public class Bicycle extends Vehicle {
    // The Bicycle class has an additional instance variable: numGears

    // Add a constructor that takes two parameters (just maxSpeed and numGears),
    // the number of wheels is obvious for a bike

    // Add a constructor that takes one parameter (just speed)
    // the number of wheels is obvious for a bike
    // because numGears is not supplied, the bike probably has just a single gear

    // Add a default constructor (no parameters)

    // Add a getter and setter for numGears

    // No other code needed
